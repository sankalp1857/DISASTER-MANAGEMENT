Arduino Uno

Arduino Uno, a basic  component while entering into the field of 
Embedded Systems, is a microcontroller board  based upon
ATmega328P. Being the  first among the USB 
Arduino boards till date, it is also the first reference model for the
Arduino platform. The bootloader present in the Atmega328P allows 
us to upload the new code without using any external hardware. The 
Original STK500 protocol is used for communication.
